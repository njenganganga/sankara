            <p>On 15 October 1987, Sankara was killed by an armed group with twelve other officials in a coup  d’etat organized by his former colleague Blaise Compaore. When accounting for his overthrow, Compaoré stated that Sankara jeopardized foreign relations with former colonial power France and neighbouring Ivory Coast, and accused his former comrade of plotting to assassinate opponents.</p>
            <P>According to Halouna Traoré, the sole survivor of Sankara's assassination, Sankara was attending a meeting with the Conseil de l'Entente. His assassins singled out Sankara and executed him.
